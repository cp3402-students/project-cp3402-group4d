### Descriptions

#### `index.php`
This is the main template file used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query. It is the most generic template in the theme and is required for all WordPress themes. It pulls in the header, footer, and sidebar, and contains the main loop to display posts.

#### `header.php`
This file contains the header section of the theme. It typically includes the siteâ€™s logo, navigation menu, and other elements that should appear at the top of every page.

#### `footer.php`
This template file is used to display the footer section of the site. It contains the closing of the #content div and all content after, typically including site credits, footer navigation, and social media links.

#### `functions.php`
This file is crucial for adding theme support and enqueuing scripts and styles. It can also be used to define custom functions, shortcodes, and other theme-specific functionality.

#### `single.php`
This is the template file used for displaying individual posts. It includes the post content, metadata, and navigation to other posts.

#### `archive.php`
The template file used for displaying archive pages, such as category, tag, author, and date archives. It includes a loop to display a list of posts in the archive.

#### `search.php`
This file is used to display search results pages. It shows the results of a search query and includes a loop to display the matching posts or a message if no results are found.

## Design Decisions
- **Colors**: The theme uses a specific color scheme that reflects the brand identity. Primary colors are #333333 for text and #ffffff for backgrounds, with accent colors #0073e6 for links and buttons.
- **Typography**: The theme uses Google Fonts 'Roboto' for body text and 'Montserrat' for headings to ensure readability and a modern look.
- **Layout**: The layout is responsive, using a grid system to ensure content is well-organized and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Images**: Images are optimized for web use, with specific dimensions set to ensure consistency across the site.

  - WordPress installation
  - Local development environment (e.g., VVV, XAMPP)

## Customization

- **Customizing Templates**: Edit the respective template files (e.g., `single.php`, `archive.php`) to change the layout or content structure.
- **Adding New Features**: To add new features or functionalities, define custom functions in `functions.php` and ensure they follow WordPress coding standards.

## Best Practices
